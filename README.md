## Fundamentals of Programming: Understanding C# 
- Using Data
- Making decisions
- Looping: 
#### doWhile, while, for.
#### Exercises:
1. Write a console-based application that prompts a user for an hourly pay rate. While the user enters values less than $5.65 or greater than $49.99, continue to prompt the user. Before the program ends, display the valid pay rate.

2. Write a console-based application that sums the integers from 1 to 50

3. EDIT TO USE LOOPS
         Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Ask a user to guess the random number, then display the random number and a message indicating whether the user's guess was too high, too low, or correct.
         ------HINT-------
         You can create a random number that is at least min but less than max using the following statements;
         Random randomGenerator = new Random();
         int randomNumber = randomGenerator.Next(min,max);  1, 11
